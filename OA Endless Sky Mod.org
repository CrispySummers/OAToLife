*** use ChatGPT to convert descriptions on the EG of important star systems (the capital systems of Major Empires) to files for an ES mod
[2025-05-24 শনি 18:32]
*** stuff I came up with in my productive meditation session
- why am I doing this?

	- to make a test bed upon which we could make content for a Real Game
	- to graph OA's Map
- what is the objective?
	- create planets, ships, and star systems representing OA in Endless Sky
- what do I already know
	- there are some groups of factions that I should include
		- Muuh
		- Other Aliens
		- Caretaker Gods
		- The Eternal
		- Sephirotic Empires
		- Stella Umma
		- Ahuman Empires
			- Diamond Network
			- Panvirtuality
		- Silicon Generation
	- here are some I could make first
		- Heartland
		- Turing
		- Crystallographer's Nightmare
- what don't I know that I need to find out?
	- is Endless Sky the best option to scaffold upon?
	- what will the members think of me making this?

*** more stuff
- why am I doing this?
  for fun. and for scaffolding. and also so that I can play the OA game I never had!
- what is the objective?
  Create a Endless Sky Mod representing the planets, stations, and stars of the OA universe to help with scaffolding stuff for the Real Game
- what do I already know about this project?
  - I know that I need to add stuff from these factions
    - ahuman empires (Panvirtuallity, Diamond Network)
    - Sephirotic Empires
    - Minor Polities
      - Stella Umma
      - Perseus Princes
      - Orion Federation
  - I also need to add descriptions
  - I'll definitely have to come up with my own systems; most of the galactographic stuff in OA isn't really filled in
    - that'll be fun though!
  - I'll also have to add archai nodes
  - I will reuse most of the graphics from Endless Sky, but will have to come up with some of my own for special cases (like Heartland's stations)
    - I must make sure to look them look like ES though!
  - let's imagine the end product
    - I'll have to add wormholes instead of hyperlanes for sure
    - I also need to add hard sci-fi ships... or maybe not, since I'm simply scaffolding stars and planets and campaigns and stuff. but then again you need ships for campaigns
    - I might also add multiple starts, like one for starting as a nearbaseline, another for starting as an AI, another for starting as a member of one of the provolve clades, e.t.c
    - I could add a "slowboat" feature to ES itself to simulate manually going through flatspace lol, which is a much slower alternative to the Jump Drive.
- what don't I know that I need to find out?
  - how do I best make this?
  - whom can I recruit?
  - why did previous OA gamemaking attempts fail? like Freehauler
    - ask the Forum
- what can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?
  - Modmakers
- who can I talk to who might provide insights?
  - modmakers
- stuff from notes
  - an interstellar war might be good for a campaign... but only if it is between modosophonts; wars between transaps is irrelevant to modosophonts except to hide or run from.
  - see if NAEV is a better option for scaffolding
